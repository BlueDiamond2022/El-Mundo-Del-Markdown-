<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to <code>nvm</code>! :tada::+1:</p>
<p>We love pull requests and issues, they're our favorite.</p>
<p>The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to <code>nvm</code> managed by <a href="https://github.com/ljharb">@LJHarb</a>, which is hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.</p>
<p>However, before submitting, please review the following:</p>
<h1>How Can I Contribute?</h1>
<p>There are lots of ways to get involved. Here are some suggestions of things we'd love some help with.</p>
<h2>Resolving existing issues</h2>
<p>You can consider helping out with issues already requiring attention - look for a &quot;help wanted&quot; label.</p>
<h3>How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug Report? :bug:</h3>
<p>Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a clear and descriptive title</strong> for the issue to identify the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem</strong> in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, <strong>don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it</strong>. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or a command, and if so which one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps</strong>. Include links to files or Github projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines">Markdown code blocks</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps</strong> and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide as much context as possible</strong> in order to help others verify and ultimately fix the issue. This includes giving us as much details as possible about your environment, so we can more easily confirm the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>We are happy to welcome contributions from anyone willing to improve documentation by adding missing information or making it more consistent and coherent.</p>

<h3>Pull requests</h3>
<h4>Before creating a pull request</h4>
<ul>
<li>Please include tests. Changes with tests will be merged very quickly.</li>
<li>Please manually confirm that your changes work in <code>bash</code>, <code>sh</code>/<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, and <code>zsh</code>. Fast tests do run in these shells, but it's nice to manually verify also.</li>
<li>Please maintain consistent whitespace - 2-space indentation, trailing newlines in all files, etc.</li>
<li>Any time you make a change to your PR, please rebase freshly on top of the default branch. Nobody likes merge commits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you don't have all of these items covered, please still feel free to submit a PR/issue! Someone else may be inspired and volunteer to complete it for you.</p>
